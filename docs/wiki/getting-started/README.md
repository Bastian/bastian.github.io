Welcome to the Javacord wiki! :man_teacher:

This wiki will help you to get started with your first Discord bot as fast as possible.

## :books: Structure of the wiki

The wiki is divided into four groups:
* **Getting Started** focuses on teaching you how to setup up everything to get the most basic bot working.
* **Basic tutorials** contains articles about various concepts and classes of Javacord. Take a look at the headlines of each artcile and decide yourself, if it is relevant for you.
* **Advanced Topics** focuses on some more advanced topics that are not stricly necessary to start working with Javacord, but might become handy later on.
* **Essential Knowlege** teaches you the most important Java features/classes that you should know to comfortably work with Javacord. If you already have decent Java knowlege, you can skip this completely.


## :handshake: Support
